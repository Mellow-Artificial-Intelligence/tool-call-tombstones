    "# Tombstoning Tool Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the concept of **tombstoning tool calls** to reduce token consumption in LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: When tool calls return very long outputs, we can replace them with summarized versions after their first use, reducing token consumption by up to ~95%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source**: Mentioned in a recent [Anthropic podcast on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuvKFsktX0Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Approaches Demonstrated**:\n",
    "1. **Naive Tombstoning**: Manual replacement with a short summary\n",
    "2. **LLM-Derived Tombstoning**: Using an LLM to automatically summarize tool outputs into 5 words or less"
